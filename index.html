        the responders f rom the IT sector selected ‚other’. The list of indicated professions

    <h2>SALARY LEVEL</h2>

    <div id="containerVertical"></div>

    <h3>
        Answers provided by the respondents show that salary levels in IT are higher than in
        other sectors. Only 2% of women in IT earn less than PLN 1,500 net. 19.7% earn between
        PLN 1,500 and 3,000 net, 20.1% - between PLN 3,000 and 4,000 net, 16.4% between PLN
        4,000 and 5,000 net, and 11.5% between PLN 5,000 and 6,000 net. With these results, however, I do not
        have a comparison with the earnings of men entering the labor market. You still hear about significant
        disproportions in this respect, and the respondents themselves believe that they earn less than their colleagues
        in the same positions.

<h3>The  biggest  group  of  respondents  f rom  the  IT  sector  works  in  specialised  positions  as
a  junior  specialist  (27%),  specialist  (40%)  or  senior  specialist  (9.5%).  Only  3.4%  of  the
    respondents do internships. The sample included also company owners and CEOs. 5% of
the responders f rom the IT sector selected ‚other’. The list of indicated professions
    included:  Programmer,  Software  Tester,  Product  Owner,  Scrum  Master,  Project  Manager,
Analyst.</h3>

<h2>SALARY LEVEL</h2>

<div id="containerVertical"></div>

<h3>
    Answers  provided  by  the  respondents  show  that  salary  levels  in  IT  are  higher  than  in
    other sectors. Only 2% of women in IT earn less than PLN 1,500 net. 19.7% earn between
    PLN 1,500 and 3,000 net, 20.1% - between PLN 3,000 and 4,000 net, 16.4% between PLN
    4,000 and 5,000 net, and 11.5% between PLN 5,000 and 6,000 net. With these results, however, I do not
    have a comparison with the earnings of men entering the labor market. You still hear about significant
    disproportions in this respect, and the respondents themselves believe that they earn less than their colleagues in the same positions.
